**# Git and GitHub Notes**



**## GitHub Setup**

**- Created a GitHub account with a professional username.**

**- This repository will be used throughout the bootcamp to track my work.**



**## Git Configuration**

**- Configured global username and email using git config.**

**- Verified Git installation from the command line.**



**## Why Git is Important**

**- Tracks changes in code over time.**

**- Allows recovery from mistakes.**

**- Enables collaboration with other developers.**

**- Acts as a public portfolio for employers.**



**## Binary Files Awareness**

**I do not commit the following to Git:**

**- Large media files (images, videos)**

**- Data dumps**

**- zip / tar archives**

**- Compiled binaries**



**Git is optimized for text-based files. Binary files increase repository size**

**and do not diff or merge efficiently.**
